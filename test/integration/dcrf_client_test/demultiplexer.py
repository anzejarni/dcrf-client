        # channelsmultiplexer's implementation of websocket_accept will accept
        # the websocket connection when the _first_ upstream application accepts.
        # This can get hairy during tests, as the client can only judge a websocket's
        # readiness by whether the connection has been accepted â€” if the test is
        # making requests against the second stream, but only the first stream
        # is "accepting frames", there *will* be "Invalid multiplexed frame received
        # (stream not mapped)" errors.
        #
        # To combat this, we only accept the websocket connection when *all* the
        # streams' applications are ready. The default behaviour may be a bug.
